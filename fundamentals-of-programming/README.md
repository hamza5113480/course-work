## Introduction to programming language
This repository contains Java programs that serve as exercises to learn fundamentals of programming language.

## Topics:
 - Variables, data types, and basic operators
 - Control flow (if , else, else-if, switch)
 - Basic input/output
 - Loops (for, while, do-while)
 - Functions
## Tasks
Create following programs
* Program to calculate the area of a rectangle.
* Program that takes user input for their age and outputs whether they're eligible to vote.
* Program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on them. Print the results of these operations.
* Program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit using the conversion formula.
* Program that prompts the user to enter the radius of a circle and calculates its circumference and area using the relevant formulas.
* Program that prompts the user to enter marks for three subjects and calculates the average marks. Based on the average marks, assign a grade to the student according to predefined grading criteria.
* Program that prompts the user to enter the coordinates of two points in a 2D plane and calculates the distance between them using the distance formula.
* Program that prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 12, representing a month. Use a switch statement to print the name of the month corresponding to the number entered.
* Program that prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 7, representing a day of the week (1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, etc.). Use a switch statement to print the name of the day of the week corresponding to the number entered.
* Program that prompts the user to enter a number and then counts down from that number to 1, printing each number along the way.
* Program that prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer and calculates its factorial using a loop. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
* Program that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.
* Program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and calculates the sum of its digits using a loop.
* Program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and checks if it's a prime number using a loop.
* Program that prompts the user to enter the length of the Fibonacci sequence and then generates and prints the sequence using a loop.
* Program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number. Provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number. Use a loop for the guessing process.
* Program that prompts the user to enter the number of rows for Floyd's Triangle and then prints the triangle pattern with incremental numbers.
* Program that prompts the user to enter the size of a diamond and then prints a diamond pattern using asterisks (*) and spaces.
* Program that prints the multiplication table up to 10 in matrix form, where rows represent multiplicands and columns represent multipliers.
* Program that prompts the user to enter the number of rows for Pascal's Triangle and then prints the triangle pattern with binomial coefficients.
* Program that defines a function to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer. Prompt the user to enter a number and then call the function to calculate and print its factorial.
* Program that defines a function to check if a given string is a palindrome. Prompt the user to enter a string and then call the function to check if it's a palindrome.
* Program that defines a function to calculate the sum of all elements in an integer array. Prompt the user to enter the size of the array and its elements, and then call the function to calculate and print the sum.
* Program that defines a function to check if a given number is prime. Prompt the user to enter a number and then call the function to check if it's prime.
* Program that defines a function to calculate the area of a circle given its radius. Prompt the user to enter the radius and then call the function to calculate and print the area.
* Program that defines a function to calculate the power of a number. Prompt the user to enter the base and exponent, and then call the function to calculate and print the result.
* Program that defines a function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. Prompt the user to enter two numbers and then call the function to calculate and print the GCD.
