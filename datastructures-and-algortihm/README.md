# Tasks
1. Pointers & Arrays 
   1. Write a program with constructor function and another for destruction function.
   2. Write a program to search an element (given by user) in a 2-D array.
   3. Introduce int variables x, y, z and int* pointer variables p, q, r.
        - Set x, y, z to three distinct values. 
       - Set p, q, r to the addresses of x, y, z respectively.
       - Print with labels the values of x, y, z, p, q, r, *p, *q, *r. 
       - Print the message: Swapping values.
       - Execute the swap code: z = x; x = y; y = z; 
       - Print with labels the values of x, y, z, p, q, r, *p, *q, *r.
2. Singly Linked List
   1. Write a program to display string using linked list.
      - Take a string of character from user and split the string in character, and then insert each character into linked list.
      - Example: String = "RPI"
   2. Consider a scenario where a firm wants to maintain the data of its employees. The data containing employee number, name, and salary and department # are saved in a singly linked list. Create following functions for the employee list.

      - InsertAtEnd:  Insertion of a record at the end.
      - Insert:  Insertion of a record at any position in the list
      - DeleteFirst: Deletion of first record.
      - DeleteLast: Deletion of last record.
      - Delete: Deletion of a record at any position in the list.
      - Search: Searching any record based on employee number and dept no.
      - Display:  Displaying all records.
   3. Write a program to split a single linked list in two separate lists and display the both lists.
