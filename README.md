# course-work:
 This repository contains course-work for my bachelor's degree (Software Engineering NUST). The content is mostly the lab work that I did in my bcahelor's degree. The repo has following content:

  - fundamental's of programm
  - object oriented programming
  - data structures and algorithms
  - databases
  - computer organization and architecture

`I also have the content of labs on Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Web Technologies, Data Warehousing and Data Mining, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in a private repository. They are lacking structure and are not well organized. I will try to organize them and upload them here.
