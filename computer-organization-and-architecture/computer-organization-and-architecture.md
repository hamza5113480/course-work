17. Write a single instruction that sets the high 8 bits of AX and does not change the low 8 bits.
18. Write a program to print the sum of series 1+3+6+  …  n and also print the value of ax and bx after each step.
19. Write a program to print the smallest number from three integers.
20. Write an assembly language program that will repeatedly prompt for a number. After each number is entered, display the sum and average of all the numbers entered so far.
21. Write an assembly language code that implements the following if statement. Input an integer from user and store in DX.
    `if (value < -1000) or (value > 1000) then
    value := 0;
    end if;`
22. Write an assembly language code that takes input an integer (less than 10) from user and print it in English word e.g.
    `    Please Input an integer (less than 10) = 6
    You have Entered = Six`
23. Write an assembly language code that takes input an integer from user and print if its even or odd.
24. Write a program in assembly to check if the number is positive or negative.
25. Write a program in assembly to check following condition
    `    If (num >0) and (num <100)
    Num=num*2`
26. Write a program in assembly which takes marks from the user and allot the grade accordingly
    - A --> 100-80
    - B --> 70-79
    - C --> 60-69
    - D --> 50-59
    - F --> 0-49
    - If number is not in range display message “Incorrect number Entered”.
27. Write a code in assembly language to print Fibonacci series. The number of terms to be calculated will be entered by the user.
28. Write a program in assembly to break and print a 5-digit number in reverse order.
29. Compute the following equation in assembly language. N will be entered by the user.

30. Write a code to convert a decimal number into binary using assembly language.
31. Write an assembly language program that will prompt for an integer n and the print the table of n upto 20 on screen.
32. Write an assembly language program that will prompt for an integer n, compute the factorial of n and display it on screen.
33. Write an assembly language program that will prompt for and input each number.  Assume that no more than 10 numbers will be entered. Display the sum of the numbers, how many numbers were entered, the average of the numbers, and the count of array entries that are greater than or equal to the average value.
34. Write an assembly language program that inputs a collection of integers into an array and implements sequential search for a particular integer entered by the user.
35. Write a program in assembly that takes two number from user in a procedure and calculates area in main procedure.
