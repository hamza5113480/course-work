2. Write a program that input a character from user. The program will display it ten times on screen in newline.
3. Write a program that will display uppercase letters (A-Z), using loop on new line.
4. Write a program that takes two numbers from user and display their sum as follows:
    - Enter first number: 25
    - Enter second number: 50
    - The sum of two numbers is: 75
5. Write a program that reads five unsigned integers from user and display sum of those five integers on the screen.   
6. Write a program that Multiply two bytes variables Var1=-10 and Var2=2 and stores the result in memory.
7. Write a program to use the SCAN_NUM to input prompt for values for three variables x, y and z and the PRINT_NUM to display an appropriate label and value of the expression` x – y + 2z – 1. `
8. Write an assembly language program that prompts for and inputs the length, width, and height of a box and calculates and displays its surface area.
   ` surface area = 2 * (length * width + length * height + width * height)`
9. Write an assembly language program that takes a number from user and finds its factorial.
10. Write an assembly language program that takes a number from user and prints its table.
11. Write an assembly language program that  takes a number from a user and find its square and cube.
12. Write a program that divide word size variables Var1=-500 and Var2=2 and stores the result in memory.
13. Write an assembly language program that prompts for inputs %marks of four exams M1, M2, M3, and M4. Suppose that M4 is a final exam that counts twice as much as the other three. Calculate the sum (adding the last grade twice) and the average (sum/5). Display the sum and average on two lines of a message box, each line with an appropriate label.
14. Write a program that takes input from user in Celsius and Convert the temperature to Fahrenheit.
    `F = (9/5) *C + 32`
15. Solve the following equation:
    `Z=x+x2/2+x3/3+x4/4`
16. Write a single instruction that clears the high 8 bits of AX and does not change the low 8 bits.
17. Write a single instruction that sets the high 8 bits of AX and does not change the low 8 bits.
18. Write a program to print the sum of series 1+3+6+  …  n and also print the value of ax and bx after each step.
19. Write a program to print the smallest number from three integers.
20. Write an assembly language program that will repeatedly prompt for a number. After each number is entered, display the sum and average of all the numbers entered so far.
21. Write an assembly language code that implements the following if statement. Input an integer from user and store in DX.
    `if (value < -1000) or (value > 1000) then
    value := 0;
    end if;`
22. Write an assembly language code that takes input an integer (less than 10) from user and print it in English word e.g.
    `    Please Input an integer (less than 10) = 6
    You have Entered = Six`
23. Write an assembly language code that takes input an integer from user and print if its even or odd.
24. Write a program in assembly to check if the number is positive or negative.
25. Write a program in assembly to check following condition
    `    If (num >0) and (num <100)
    Num=num*2`
26. Write a program in assembly which takes marks from the user and allot the grade accordingly
    - A --> 100-80
    - B --> 70-79
    - C --> 60-69
    - D --> 50-59
    - F --> 0-49
    - If number is not in range display message “Incorrect number Entered”.
27. Write a code in assembly language to print Fibonacci series. The number of terms to be calculated will be entered by the user.
